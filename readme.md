1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

getElementById => get `one specific id`
getElementsByClassName => get `all elements of same class name` (more than one)

querySelector => From more than one id or class,  get the `first element of id or class`
querySelectorAll => It selects `all elements of same id or class name`
